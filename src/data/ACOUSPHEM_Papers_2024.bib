ABSTRACT = {Pumice forms when a volcanic explosion ejects highly pressurized, superheated rock, rapidly cooling and depressurizing, resulting in a porous structure. In countries with high volcanic activity, pumice stone is a low-cost natural material that is lightweight, non-toxic, eco-friendly, durable, and heat-resistant. Among other applications, pumice has been used as an aggregate to produce lightweight concrete or cementitious material to produce blended cement or geopolymer. Since pumice stone is highly porous, it could be used as a naturally occurring multiscale porous sound-absorbing material, which may add interesting properties for absorbing sound energy. Normally, a double-porosity granular material presents higher sound absorption at low frequencies than a solid-grain material with the same mesoscopic characteristics at a reduced weight. This study uses theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate the sound absorption characteristics of granular pumice samples. The tests were conducted on crushed pumice stones in granular form. The study suggests that pumice stones can be used as a novel material for sound absorption in room acoustics and noise control applications.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates acoustic wave propagation in wet rigid-frame porous media accounting for evaporation and condensation. At equilibrium, the solid walls are covered by a thin water film, and water vapor in the air is at its temperature-dependent saturation pressure. Small acoustic perturbations cause water to vaporize or condense, which together with the reversibility of the phase change, lead to a linear problem where the usual local poro-acoustics physics is enriched with the (i) Clapeyron relation linking liquid-wall temperature, vapor pressure, and latent heat of vaporization, (ii) latent heat transfer in the solid frame, (iii) diffusion equation for water vapor in air, and (iv) water vapor's equation of state. The equilibrium temperature highly influences the vapor concentration and the physical parameters of saturated moist air. Using the two-scale asymptotic homogenization method, it is shown that the dynamic permeability is determined similarly to classical porous media, while the effective compressibility is modified by evaporation/condensation and the equilibrium temperature. This modification is influenced by vapor mass and heat flows associated with phase changes through a local fully coupled heat transfer and water vapor diffusion problem, with specific boundary conditions at the gas–water interface. The analysis identifies dimensionless parameters and characteristic frequencies defining the upscaled model's features. Depending on equilibrium temperature, the theory qualitatively and quantitatively determines the characteristics of acoustic waves propagating through the media. The results are illustrated and discussed with analytically developed models.},

  abstract = {Multiscale oscillatory heat transfer and fluid flow of a gas in permeable media subjected to acoustic wave excitation is investigated in this paper. The two-scale asymptotic method of homogenisation is used to establish the macroscopic description of acoustic wave propagation in such media With the aid of this method, an effective complex-valued frequency-dependent volumetric heat capacity that describes the thermal response of the gas in a permeable medium, accounting for the finite heat capacity of its solid frame, to an acoustic wave is introduced Analytical models for materials with simple geometry and scaling functions for those with complex geometry are provided. These predict the behaviour in frequency of the dynamic volumetric heat capacity and effective compressibility of a fluid equivalent to the permeable material. The latter effective parameter is shown to be affected by the finite heat capacity of the materials’ solid frame as well. The predictions of both types of models are successfully compared with the results of direct pore-scale numerical simulations. Extensions of the developed theory to account for rarefied heat transfer and fluid flow as well as multiple scales of porosity (e.g., double porosity materials and porous composites) are also presented. This study provides insight into the fundamental understanding of heat transfer phenomena in permeable media subjected to acoustic excitation and paves the way for further studies on the use of acoustic waves to measure the volumetric heat capacity of the solid-frame substrate material of simple and multiscale permeable media.},

  abstract = { Despite significant progress in deciphering the mechanical properties of nanoporous materials, the intimately related phenomenon of acoustic wave propagation in such solids remains largely unexplored at this vanishing length scale (i.e., the molecular scale). Here, we report a multiscale approach to estimate the acoustic properties of zeolites─a prototypical class of nanoporous materials─by combining molecular dynamics simulations and a rigorous upscaling approach using continuum mechanics. Two different zeolites are considered, i.e., RHO and JST zeolites; while they share a simple yet different crystallographic structure, the latter shows auxeticity. First, microscopic simulations are used to calculate the speed of sound from the phonon spectrum as obtained using molecular displacement and velocity data. As an alternate route, macroscopic mechanical constants of the materials are also determined to confirm the inferred acoustic velocities by solving the Kelvin–Christoffel equation. These mechanical constants are obtained either using the strain fluctuations in a simulation performed at equilibrium or from the slope of the stress–strain curve assessed using simple mechanical tests. Second, we propose a nano-to-macro modeling strategy in which the inputs for the continuum-level upscaled model are the specific outcomes from the molecular calculations (e.g., speeds of sound, mechanical parameters). This strategy allows determining the acoustic properties of an empty double porosity material formed by adding an extra scale of porosity to a nanoporous skeleton. Such an extra scale of porosity can represent larger pores, voids in between consolidated nanoporous grains, and/or possible large defects or microfractures in the nanoporous skeleton whose effects can be probed by acoustic waves. This work paves the way for further studies in the field of nanoscale acoustics─especially in the context of applications involving nanoporous materials. },

  abstract = {An impervious membrane sound absorber with an air cavity partially filled with a porous material is a viable alternative to perforated panels when impermeable surfaces are required. On the other hand, due to its unusually high sound absorption properties at low frequencies, using activated carbon (AC) in granular form as an absorbing material has recently received attention. This paper reports the sound absorption performance of a novel system consisting of a thin stretched impervious circular membrane made of silicone, backed by an air cavity partially filled with granular AC. The system is analyzed theoretically using the impedance translation theorem. The normal-incidence sound absorption was measured in an impedance tube for combinations of cavity depth, membrane tension, and membrane surface density. The results of using an AC and a fiberglass infill material of the same thickness in the air cavity were also compared. The findings validated the advantage of AC as porous infill material of a membrane sound absorber in the low-frequency range. Furthermore, the outcomes of the impedance tube experiments were in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The findings reported in this work could be used to design new innovating sound-absorbing metamaterials based on activated carbon and stretched membranes.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the acoustics of permeo-elastic media. These media comprise a rigid porous skeleton with attached elastic films that interact with the fluid that saturates the pores. The pore-scale fluid/film interaction introduces elastic energy that interacts with viscous dissipation and inertial effects. The corresponding non-conventional flow regimes are studied by the two-scale asymptotic homogenisation method by successively considering permeo-elastic media with (i) fully connected pores, (ii) strictly unconnected pores (i.e. pores closed by films), (iii) partially connected pores, and (iv) mixed morphologies. This analysis allows to precisely describe how the morphology both influences, quantitatively and qualitatively, the interaction of the elastic and kinetic energies of the films with the viscous and kinetic energies of the fluid, and modifies the effective properties. It is shown that, in specific frequency ranges, the film–fluid system behaves as an equivalent visco-elastic fluid and that local film–fluid resonances can be observed. Numerical examples illustrate the main features in the different cases. The presented synthetic approach enables the design of materials that exhibit unconventional conductivity, unconventional compressibility, or both, in different or the same frequency range, by means of tuning their morphological and/or mechanical parameters.},

  abstract = {At first glance, it seems that modern, inexpensive additive manufacturing (AM) technologies can be used to produce innovative, efficient acoustic materials with tailored pore morphology. However, on closer inspection, it becomes rather obvious that for now this is only possible for specific solutions, such as relatively thin, but narrow-band sound absorbers. This is mainly due to the relatively poor resolutions available in low-cost AM technologies and devices, which prevents the 3D-printing of pore networks with characteristic dimensions comparable to those found in conventional broadband sound-absorbing materials. Other drawbacks relate to a number of imperfections associated with AM technologies, including porosity or rather microporosity inherent in some of them. This paper shows how the limitations mentioned above can be alleviated by 3D-printing double-porosity structures, where the main pore network can be designed and optimised, while the properties of the intentionally microporous skeleton provide the desired permeability contrast, leading to additional broadband sound energy dissipation due to pressure diffusion. The beneficial effect of additively manufactured double porosity and the phenomena associated with it are rigorously demonstrated and validated in this work, both experimentally and through precise multiscale modelling, on a comprehensive example that can serve as benchmark.},

  abstract = {{This paper investigates acoustic wave propagation in gas-saturated permeable lossy metamaterials, which have different types of resonators, namely, acoustic and elastic resonators, as building-block elements. By using the two-scale asymptotic homogenization method, the macroscopic equations that govern sound propagation in such metamaterials are established. These equations show that the metamaterials can be modeled as equivalent fluids with unconventional effective density and compressibility. Analysis of these frequency-dependent and complex-valued parameters shows that the real parts of both can take negative values within frequency bands determined by inner resonances. The upscaled theory is exemplified with the case of a permeable lossy metamaterial having a unit cell comprising two unconnected fluid networks and a solid frame. One of these fluid networks is loaded with acoustic resonators (e.g., quarter-wavelength, Helmholtz resonators), while thin elastic films are present in the other one. It is shown that the propagation of acoustic waves in permeable lossy metamaterials is determined by both classical visco-thermal dissipation and local elasto-inertial resonances. The results are expected to lead to judicious designs of acoustic materials with peculiar properties including negative phase velocity and phase constant characteristic for regressive waves, very slow phase velocity, and wide sub-wavelength bandgaps.}},

  abstract = {Acoustic wave propagation in porous composites is investigated in this paper. The two-scale asymptotic homogenisation method is used to obtain the macroscopic description of sound propagation in such composites. The developed theory is both exemplified by introducing analytical models for the effective acoustical properties of porous composites with canonical inclusion patterns (i.e. a porous matrix with a periodic array of cylindrical or spherical inclusions) and validated by comparing the models predictions with the results of direct finite-element simulations and experimental testing, showing good agreement in all cases. It is concluded that the developed theory correctly captures the acoustic interaction between the constituents of the porous composite and elucidates the physical mechanisms underlying the dissipation of sound energy in such composites. These correspond to classical visco-thermal dissipation in the porous constituents, together with, for the case of composites made from constituents characterised by highly contrasted permeabilities, pressure diffusion which provides additional and tunable sound energy dissipation. In addition, this work determines the conditions for which a rigidly-backed porous composite layer can present improved sound absorption performance in comparison with that of layers made from their individual constituents. Hence, the presented results are expected to guide the rational design of porous composites with superior acoustic performance.},

Aerogel samples are produced through a two-step, acid-base sol-gel process, with sol silica concentration and density being the main variables. Their pore structure is carefully characterized by nitrogen sorption analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The acoustical properties of hard-backed granular silica aerogels are measured in an impedance tube and the results predicted accurately with the adopted theoretical model. Although silica aerogels have over 90\% of open interconnected pores, this was neither reflected in the measured acoustical properties nor the parameter values predicted with the model. Novel results show that only a proportion of the micro and mesopores in the direct vicinity of the grain surface influenced the acoustical properties of aerogels. Further work in the hierarchical pore structure of aerogels is required to better understand the roles of different pore scales on the measured acoustical properties of a granulated aerogel.}},

              degeneracy and mode hybridisation are investigated in the linear regime.
              It is shown that the tangential force-dependent shear stiffness between
              the spheres and the rail strongly influences the dispersion relations,
              while the influence of the torque-dependent torsional stiffness is much
              weaker. The inclination angle of the rail is examined as another tunable
              degree of freedom, which modifies the wave dispersion not only by
              changing the shear coupling but also by influencing the coupling among
              different types of waves. The tunability of the wave dynamics in the
              granular chain evidenced in this work offers a flexible way of designing
              acoustic systems for selective vibration filtering and wave
              manipulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A variety of new porous materials with unusually small pores have been
              manufactured in the past decades. To predict their acoustical
              properties, the conventional models need to be modified. When pore size
              becomes comparable to the molecular mean free path of a saturating
              fluid, the no-slip conditions on the pore surface are no longer accurate
              and hence the slip effects have to be taken into account. In this paper,
              sound propagation in microfibrous materials is modeled analytically,
              approximating the geometry by a regular array of rigid parallel
              cylinders. It has been shown that velocity and thermal slip on a
              cylinder surface significantly changes the model predictions leading to
              lower attenuation coefficient and higher sound speed values. The
              influence of material porosity, fiber orientation, and size on these
              effects is investigated. Finite element method is used to numerically
              solve the oscillatory flow and heat transfer problems in a square array
              of cylindrical fibres. Numerical results are compared with predictions
              of the analytical model and the range of its validity is identified. (C)
