Fabricio Oyarce completed his undergraduate studies in Engineering in Acoustics at Universidad Austral de Chile, graduating with the highest honours. Throughout his academic journey, Fabricio distinguished himself through exceptional dedication to coursework and active involvement in research projects within the ACOUSPHEM group.

His thesis was entitled "Diseño, construcción y caraterización de prototipo de metamaterial acústico activo" and was supervised by Dr. Rodolfo Venegas. This work reflected Fabricio's willingness to tackle significant research challenges.

Fabricio is the latest member of ACOUSPHEM to complete his undergraduate studies and is now enrolled in the MSc programme in Acoustics and Vibrations at UACh.  We wish him continued success in this endeavour.
