Fabricio Oyarce completed his undergraduate Engineering in Acoustics degree at Universidad Austral de Chile, graduating with highest honours. Throughout his academic journey, Fabricio distinguished himself through exceptional dedication to coursework and active involvement in research projects within the ACOUSPHEM group.

His thesis, entitled "Diseño, construcción y caraterización de prototipo de metamaterial acústico activo", supervised by Rodolfo Venegas. This work reflects Fabricio’s genuine interest in acoustics and his willingness to engage with research challenges.

Fabricio is the newest member of ACOUSPHEM to complete this degree. We wish him continued success in his future endeavours.
