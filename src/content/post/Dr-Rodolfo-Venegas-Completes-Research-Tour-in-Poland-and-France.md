Dr Rodolfo Venegas, an academic of the UACh Institute of Acoustics, recently concluded  research activities as part of the Fondecyt Regular 1211310 and OPUS 21 projects. His journey included his participation at Internoise 2024 in Nantes, France, where he presented his research on  hygroscopic effects on the sound absorptive properties of multiscale bio-based materials. His work was well received by the international community, further establishing the UACh Laboratory as a leader in acoustic materials research.

At Internoise 2024, an international congress that gathered over 1800 participants, Dr. Venegas not only showcased his research but also chaired a specialized session and coordinated a general topic. These roles provided him with the opportunity to moderate discussions and exchange ideas with prominent researchers in the field.

Before he participated in the conference, Dr. Venegas visited the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences. During this period, he collaborated with Dr Tomasz G. Zieliński on studies addressing sound propagation in permeo-elastic media with dual porosity.

Reflecting on these experiences, Dr Venegas stated, "It was a great honour to be invited to the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The opportunity to present our work at Internoise 2024, chair a session, and coordinate a general topic allowed us to exchange ideas with leading researchers. These experiences not only strengthen our global research standing but also open new perspectives for our future doctoral program."
