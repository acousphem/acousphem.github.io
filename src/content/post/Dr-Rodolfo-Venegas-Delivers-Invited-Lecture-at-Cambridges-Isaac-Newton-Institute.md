Dr. Rodolfo Venegas, researcher at the Institute of Acoustics of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences at UACh, recently participated in the workshop “Multiple Scattering in Engineering and Applied Sciences” at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge, UK.

The event brought together international experts to exchange ideas and explore innovative solutions in wave physics. Dr. Venegas presented an invited talk titled “Upscaling of the Wave Equation in Permeable Materials with Active Inner Sources,” showcasing recent findings from his FONDECYT Regular 1211310 project.

The workshop featured distinguished scientists, fostering academic networking and strengthening collaborations with leading researchers. Dr. Venegas highlighted the event as an opportunity for knowledge exchange and future partnerships, which could open new research opportunities for UACh's students.

He also emphasised that invitations to high-level international events reinforce the academic excellence and leadership of the Institute of Acoustics at UACh.
