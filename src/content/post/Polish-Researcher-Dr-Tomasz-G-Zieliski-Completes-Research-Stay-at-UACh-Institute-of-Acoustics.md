Dr. Tomasz G. Zieliński from the Fundamental Technological Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IPPT PAN) completed a one-month research stay at the Faculty of Engineering at Universidad Austral de Chile. His visit, part of a collaborative effort with Dr. Rodolfo Venegas from the UACh Institute of Acoustics, focused on addressing the propagation of sound in poro-elastic media with dual porosity.

Together, both researchers have published four joint articles in reputable journals such as the Journal of Sound and Vibration, Applied Acoustics, Wave Motion, and Composites Part B. Their collaboration spans various topics, including porous acoustic composite materials, metamaterials, and the homogenization of poro-piezoelectric media.

During his stay in Valdivia, Dr. Zieliński presented a seminar titled “3D Printing of Acoustic Materials: Design, Modeling, and Experimental Validation.” The presentation addressed challenges in reproducibility and the design and modelling of 3D-printed acoustic materials, highlighting strategies to control printing imperfections for the development of more efficient and innovative materials.

Dr Zieliński also noted that resolving the modelling of fibres produced by filament winding in 3D-printed acoustic materials, along with advances in the homogenization of thermo-poroelastic and poro-piezoelectric media, has been a significant achievement of their collaboration. He is even considering incorporating lectures on homogenization into his multifield modelling courses.

His research stay at UACh was sponsored by the National Science Centre of Poland, further strengthening the international ties between the institutions.
