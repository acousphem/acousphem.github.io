Felipe Orellana, a long-time member of ACOUSPHEM, has completed his Master's in Acoustics and Vibrations. His research focused on developing and characterising active metamaterials using microspeakers, aiming to synthesize the acoustic absorption coefficientâ€”something that is not possible with conventional passive materials.

Felipe highlighted the research process as his experience's most valuable aspect, emphasising its challenges and rewards. His thesis was supported by our Fondecyt Regular 1211310 project and the evaluation committee included experts from academia and industry.
