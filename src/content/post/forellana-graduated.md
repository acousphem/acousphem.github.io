Felipe Orellana, a long-time member of ACOUSPHEM, has completed his Master's in Acoustics and Vibrations. His research focused on developing and characterising active metamaterials using microspeakers, aiming to synthesize the acoustic absorption coefficientâ€”something not possible with conventional passive materials.

Felipe highlighted the research process as his experience's most valuable aspect, emphasising its challenges and rewards. Motivated by his findings, he is now planning future doctoral studies to further explore active metamaterials.

His thesis was conducted within the Fondecyt Regular 1211310 project, led by Dr. Rodolfo Venegas, with an evaluation committee that included experts from academia and industry.
