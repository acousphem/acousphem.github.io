During the first quarter of 2022, two international academic exchanges took place under the Fondecyt Regular 1211310 project led by Dr. Rodolfo Venegas of the UACh Institute of Acoustics, Faculty of Engineering Sciences. These exchanges involved visits between UACh and the École Nationale des Travaux Publics de l’État (ENTPE) of the Université de Lyon, featuring collaborative work by Dr. Venegas and Dr. Claude Boutin.

Together, they advanced theories on acoustic wave propagation in permeable materials with internal sources, using sophisticated physical and mathematical methods. Some of the results have already been submitted for publication, while others will be presented at an upcoming international conference.
