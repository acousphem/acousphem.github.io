Claudio C. Parra, a member of ACOUSPHEM, acoustical engineer and master's thesis student in Acoustics and Vibrations at UACh, has been awarded the prestigious CIRE Scholarship by the Acoustical Society of America (ASA). This international scholarship recognizes the significant contributions of his research on acoustic wave propagation in porous materials with internal sources.

Claudio’s research is carried out within the framework of the Fondecyt Regular 1211310 project. The monetary support and a three-year student membership to ASA, which grants access to the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America and other publications, provide Claudio with greater confidence and resources to further his investigation.

The ASA, established in 1929, is a renowned international scientific society dedicated to advancing the knowledge and practical applications of acoustics. Its International Research and Education Committee (CIRE), formed in 1992, strives to enhance ASA’s role in global research and education.

Dr. Venegas expressed his pride in Claudio’s achievement, stating, "This scholarship bears testament to Claudio’s hard work and dedication. It is gratifying to see how this opportunity will further his research and professional development".
