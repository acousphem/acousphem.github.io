The Acoustic Phenomena in Matter (ACOUSPHEM) research group, led by Dr. Rodolfo Venegas of the UACh Institute of Acoustics, has expanded its team with the addition of three international researchers. The group, dedicated to advancing the understanding of acoustic phenomena in matter, emphasises collaborative innovation and student-driven research.

ACOUSPHEM’s work is supported by diverse funding sources, including the ANID-funded Fondecyt Regular project, InnovING2030, VIDCA, and shared partnerships with institutions such as the Université de Grenoble. This framework has enabled the integration of foreign researchers into the team during the first semester of 2023:

* Dr. Alan Sam (India), a postdoctoral researcher affiliated with UACh, Université de Grenoble, and LIPhy CNRS, is investigating the acoustics of nanoporous materials under the international IRGA 2021 initiative.
* Lucien Mutel (France), a civil engineering master’s student from ENTPE and Université de Lyon, is analysing multi-scale poroelastic materials.
* Edgar Joinneau (France), also from ENTPE and Université de Lyon, is exploring active acoustic metamaterials.

Their research contributes to the Fondecyt Regular 1211310 project, directed by Dr Venegas, which aims to develop theories of acoustic wave propagation in permeable materials with internal sources.

The ACOUSPHEM team includes UACh academics such as Dr. Venegas and Prof. Juan Rebolledo (Institute of Materials and Thermomechanical Processes), alongside graduate and undergraduate students specialising in acoustics and vibrations. The group’s growth reflects its commitment to fostering long-term international partnerships and supporting emerging researchers.
