The enhancement of international collaboration in the field of acoustic materials was a key outcome of Dr. Rodolfo Venegas’ participation at Forum Acusticum 2023 in Torino, Italy. During the event, Dr. Venegas presented two research works addressing advanced materials for reducing speaker size and acoustic absorption. One project, conducted under the "Meta-loudspeakers" international collaboration and funded by the 2022 FCI UACh – Innoving 2030 International Collaboration Fund, was showcased alongside new results from his Fondecyt Regular 1211310 project.

Dr. Venegas noted that both presentations were very well received, and he highlighted the active involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the research efforts. He also emphasized that the funding has facilitated the expansion of his international network, now including partnerships with Holoplot from Germany and two Chinese institutions—Qingdao University of Technology and the University of Electronic Science and Technology—as well as reinforced internal collaboration with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at his faculty.

This successful participation further strengthens the Institute of Acoustics at UACh as a leader in research on materials for acoustic applications. The congress was part of the activities supported by ANID-funded projects under InnovING2030 and Fondecyt Regular 1211310.
