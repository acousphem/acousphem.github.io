The enhancement of international collaboration in the field of acoustic materials was a key outcome of Dr. Rodolfo Venegas’ participation at Forum Acusticum 2023 in Torino, Italy. During the event, Dr. Venegas presented two works addressing advanced materials for loudspeaker's form factor reduction and sound absorption. One work, carried out within the framework of the  "Meta-loudspeakers" international collaboration funded by the 2022 FCI UACh – Innoving 2030 International Collaboration Fund, was showcased alongside new results from his Fondecyt Regular 1211310 project.

Dr. Venegas noted that both presentations were very well received and highlighted the active involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the research works. He also emphasised that the funding has facilitated the expansion of ACOUSPHEM's  international network, now including partnerships with Holoplot from Germany and two Chinese institutions—Qingdao University of Technology and the University of Electronic Science and Technology—as well as reinforced internal collaboration with the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UACh.

This successful participation further strengthens the Institute of Acoustics at UACh as a leader in research on materials for acoustic applications.
