Dr Rodolfo Venegas and Claudio C. Parra, recently undertook a research stay at the [Laboratoire des Ondes et Milieux Complexes (LOMC)](https://www.lomc.fr/) of the University of Le Havre Normandie in France, as part of Fondecyt Regular projects 1211310 and 1250496, and the ACT240015 Technology Ring.

During their visit, they delivered a seminar entitled “Wave Propagation in Porous Materials with Internal Sources”, showcasing the latest progress in their work on the acoustics of advanced materials.

Their tour of France also enabled collaborative research with Dr C. Guianvarc’h, Professor B. Morvan and Dr S. Bernard of the LOMC, thereby strengthening international ties. “A highlight of the visit was securing support for a doctoral thesis funded by the Normandy region,” commented Dr Venegas, who will act as its supervisor.

During their stay, Dr Venegas and Claudio Parra also took part in a working session at the [Laboratoire Modélisation et Simulation Multi-Échelle (MSME)](https://www.u-pec.fr/fr/recherche/laboratoires/modelisation-et-simulation-multi-echelle-msme-umr-8208) in Paris, collaborating with Professor Camille Perrot’s research group. This meeting furthered their investigations into wave propagation in multi-scale, poroelastic materials.

This visit to the French laboratories is part of ACOUSPHEM's internationalisation strategy, which aims to cultivate collaboration and strengthen academic ties with leading institutions, opening up new opportunities for future joint projects and scholarly exchanges.
