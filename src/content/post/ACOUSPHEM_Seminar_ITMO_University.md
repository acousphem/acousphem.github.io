Dr. Rodolfo Venegas, Associate Professor at the Institute of Acoustics of the Universidad Austral de Chile and Head of ACOUSPHEM, was invited to deliver an international online seminar at ITMO University (Saint Petersburg, Russia), a globally recognized institution in optics, photonics, and applied physics.

The seminar, entitled *“Wave Propagation in Hierarchical Porous Materials and Multiscale Acoustic Metamaterials”*, addressed fundamental and applied aspects of wave propagation in complex materials characterised by hierarchical structures spanning length scales from nanometres to millimetres and beyond. The talk examined the effective acoustic properties of two major classes of systems: hierarchical sorptive porous materials, where adsorption and diffusion processes play a key role, and multiscale acoustic metamaterials that combine porous media with resonant elements to tailor and control acoustic responses.

Throughout the presentation, Dr. Venegas highlighted how different physical mechanisms, including fluid–solid interactions, diffusion phenomena, and nanoscale adsorption and desorption processes, govern the acoustic behaviour of these systems. The seminar concluded with an overview of ongoing research activities at ACOUSPHEM focused on wave propagation in multiscale poroelastic media, integrating theoretical developments, numerical modelling, and experimental validation.

This invitation from ITMO University underscores the growing international visibility of ACOUSPHEM and strengthens the global scientific presence of the Institute of Acoustics at the Universidad Austral de Chile.
