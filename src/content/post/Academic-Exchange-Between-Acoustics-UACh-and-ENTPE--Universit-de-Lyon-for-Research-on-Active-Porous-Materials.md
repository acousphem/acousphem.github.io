As part of the FONDECYT Regular 1211310 project, led by Dr Rodolfo Venegas from the Institue of Acoustics at UACh, two international academic exchanges occurred during the first quarter of 2023.

Dr. Venegas visited ENTPE & Universit√© de Lyon to work with Dr. Claude Boutin on acoustic wave propagation in active porous materials. These materials represent an emerging field in acoustic engineering, offering potential applications in noise control, sound insulation, and loudspeaker design.

During his visit, Dr. Venegas also delivered seminars at the Laboratoire Vibrations Acoustique (LVA) at INSA Lyon and the Laboratoire Mod√©lisation et Simulation Multi-Echelle (MSME) at Universit√© Gustave Eiffel & Universit√© Paris-Est Cr√©teil (UPEC).

Following this, Dr. Boutin visited UACh to continue working with Dr. Venegas on active porous materials and engaged with undergraduate and graduate students at ACOUSPHEM.

Dr. Venegas highlighted the importance of these exchanges in fostering international collaboration and advancing knowledge in acoustics and mechanics. He emphasized that such initiatives contribute to the professional development of future engineers, providing them with a broader perspective and valuable interdisciplinary experience.

The FONDECYT Regular 1211310 project, now in its third year, focuses on developing and validating theories on acoustic wave propagation in porous materials with internal sources.
