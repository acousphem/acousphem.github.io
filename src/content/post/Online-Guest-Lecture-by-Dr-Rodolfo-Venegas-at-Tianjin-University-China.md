Dr Rodolfo Venegas, an academic at the Institute of Acoustics of the Universidad Austral de Chile, delivered an online guest lecture as part of the International “Lecture on Mechanics and Physics of Advanced Materials and Structures” series organized by the Wave Mechanics and Control Laboratory at Tianjin University’s Department of Mechanics.

The virtual event, which over 60 participants attended, provided an overview of the research conducted by Dr. Venegas’ group and showcased results from the Fondecyt Regular 1211310 and IRGA 2021 projects. The lecture, titled “Nano-to-macro acoustics of multiscale metamaterials,” included a Q\&A session that fostered engaging discussions and the exploration of potential collaborations among academics and students from diverse backgrounds.

Dr Venegas expressed his honour at having the opportunity to share his group’s research with the Tianjin University community, and he hopes that the lecture will pave the way for future collaborative initiatives with research groups in China.
