Dr Rodolfo Venegas, an academic at the Institute of Acoustics of the Universidad Austral de Chile, delivered an online guest lecture as part of the International “Lecture on Mechanics and Physics of Advanced Materials and Structures” series organised by the Wave Mechanics and Control Laboratory at Tianjin University’s Department of Mechanics.

The virtual event, attended by over 60 participants, provided an overview of the research conducted by Dr. Venegas’ lab and showcased results from the Fondecyt Regular 1211310 and IRGA 2021 projects. The lecture, titled “Nano-to-macro acoustics of multiscale metamaterials,” included a Q\&A session that fostered engaging discussions and the exploration of potential collaborations among academics and students from diverse backgrounds.

Dr Venegas expressed his honour at having the opportunity to share his lab’s research with the Tianjin University community, and  hopes that the lecture will pave the way for future collaborative initiatives with research groups in China.
