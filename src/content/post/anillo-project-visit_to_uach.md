ACOUSPHEM's members visited laboratories of the Civil Engineering Department at USACH as part of their joint project Anillo de Tecnolog√≠a ACT240015. The visit was hosted by Dr. E. Saavedra and included meetings with other academics of the said department, a tour of their facilities, and two seminars given by ACOUSPHEM's members Dr. R. Venegas and Claudio C. Parra where some recent results obtained in the project Fondecyt Regular 1211310 were discussed, together with advancements of the research on the acoustics of mass timber. 

We thank USACh for their warm welcome.
