The scientific work of the laboratory Acoustic Phenomena in Matter (ACOUSPHEM) is interested in understanding the influence of multiple physical phenomena on the propagation of waves in complex heterogeneous media such as multiscale permeable materials, metamaterials, as well as active and living media. We carry out theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies inspired by applications in acoustical engineering and other areas of engineering.
